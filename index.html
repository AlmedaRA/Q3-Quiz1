							<td><p>The true story of a team of unlikely underdogs -- a working-class gamer, a former race-car driver, and an idealistic motorsport executive -- who risk it all to take on the most elite sport in the world.</p></td>
							<td><p>Casts: David Harbour, Orlando Bloom, Archie Madekwe, <br><br> Director: Niell Blomkamp <br><br>Duration: 2h 14m</p></td>
							<td><p>MickyG333 17 December 2023 <br><br> I would most certainly watch 'Gran Turismo' several times, and probably will see it again in the next year or two. This is one of those dark horse films, you think it's going to be pretty good, but you are shocked by how good it really is. This is a riveting story full of intense feelings of anticipation and excitement. We are rooting for this kid who plays a video game. It doesn't get more strange. I would say this has a 'Top Gun' meets 'Ender's Game' feeling. They definitely take a few lines from 'Top Gun', and the whole premise is an 'Ender's Game' - teach the gamer how to fight real battles vs real enemies theme.
I love this movie for three reasons: it's very entertaining, the characters are very likable, the story is developed and smooth. I was on the edge of my seat for the second half, lots of adrenaline to be burned.</p></td>

							<td><p>It's been 10 years since Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) walked away from the agency that trained him to become a deadly weapon. Hoping to draw him out of the shadows, CIA director Robert Dewey assigns hacker and counterinsurgency expert Heather Lee to find him. Lee suspects that former operative Nicky Parsons is also looking for him. As she begins tracking the duo, Bourne finds himself back in action battling a sinister network that utilizes terror and technology to maintain unchecked power.</p></td>
							<td><p>Casts: Matt Damon, Tommy Lee Jones, Alicia Vicander <br><br> Director: Paul Greengrass <br><br> Duration: 2h 3m</br></td>
							<td><p>Jdring2007 28 November 2021 <br><br> You can really tell that they were grasping at straws in this one, the first Damon installment in the Bourne series for 9 years. The plot is thin at best, and added elements for surprise's sake feel silly when they come out of the blue, or predictable when they don't. That said, the acting all around is solid, except for maybe Alicia Vikander, whose character as a whole seemed like it was just tacked on to mirror Julia Stiles' from previous movies. They really do follow the Bourne formula here: one major hand to hand scene, one major chase scene, and, yes, shaky-cam. It wasn't as bad in Ultimatum (2007) as it was in the first two and not necessarily in this one either, but the dang lighting on sets was horrid and what made it worse was that literally every action scene took place at night. The major chase at the end, too, but at least it had some really cool moments in better lighting.</p></td>

							<td><p>After more than 30 years of service as one of the Navy's top aviators, Pete "Maverick" Mitchell is where he belongs, pushing the envelope as a courageous test pilot and dodging the advancement in rank that would ground him. Training a detachment of graduates for a special assignment, Maverick must confront the ghosts of his past and his deepest fears, culminating in a mission that demands the ultimate sacrifice from those who choose to fly it.</p></td>
							<td><p>Casts: Tom Cruise, Miles Teller, Jennifer Connelly </br><br> Director: Joseph Kosinski <br><br> Duration: 2h 10m</p></td>
							<td><p>DarkVulcan29 27 May 2022 <br><br> Top Gun (1986) made Tom Cruise a star, and now 36 years later he jumps back in role of Pete Mitchell AKA Maverick almost like he never left.<br>

<br>Maverick never seems let his age slow him down, and still is cocky has ever, and is ordered to train a bunch of young pilots for a deadly mission, but sees a little bit of himself in them, and must get them working together has a team.<br>

<br>Tom Cruise is great has Maverick, who is coming to terms with the past. Miles Teller and Glen Powell are also great, and not to mention Jennifer Connelly. But the flying scenes are what makes this movie, you feel like your flying with them. Feels has real has ever. A terrific sequel 36 years worth the wait.</p></td>
